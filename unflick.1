.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B unflick
extracts single images or a series of images from a given 
FLI-animation.
The extracted images are stored in separated files. 
The formats PPM (raw and ascii) and FBM (mapped 8bpp) 
are available.
Additionally
.B unflick 
can call an external filter program to convert the output 
in another file format.
The file
.I animation
contains the input FLI-animation. 
The output file names are controlled by the parameters
.I base 
and
.IR extension .
.LP
If the parameter 
.I extension
is omitted, 
the names of the generated files are composed of the 
given 
.I base 
followed by a dot and a number field:
.IP
.nf
.IR base .001,
.IR base .002,
.IR base .003,
etc.
.fi
.LP
The number indicates the position at which the image appears 
in the FLI-animation.
Note that when the input animation has more than 999 frames 
automatically more digits are used in the number field of the
file names. 
.LP
In the case of a given 
.IR extension ,
the file names consist of the
.IR base ,
directly followed by the number field, plus a
dot and the given extension:
.IP
.nf
.IR base 001. extension ,
.IR base 002. extension ,
.IR base 003. extension ,
etc.
.fi
.LP
Before a image is written to disk,
the program tests if a file with the designated name already exists. 
In this case the old file is not overwritten and the program 
terminates with an error.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Write the images in PPM ascii format instead of PPM raw.
Note that this needs much more disk space.
.TP
.BI \-b " begin"
Only the images with the number
.I begin
or higher are extracted. 
By default the extraction starts with the first image.
.TP
.B \-m
Write the images in mapped FBM format.
Then they can be converted to other formats with the utilities
of the FBM package.
.TP
.BI \-n " max"
Extract not more than
.I max
images. 
By default all images from the 
given beginning up to the end are extracted. 
With this option it is possible to extract only a part 
of the images. 
.TP
.B \-v
Write some information about the processed FLI-file to
.IR stdout .
.TP
.BI \-f " filter"
Postprocess the output with the 
specified filter. The writing is done using the
.I popen
subroutine.
This can be used to store the images in other file formats
than PPM of FBM, 
or to write directly compressed files. 
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
For example we want to extract all images from the FLI-animation
`nicefilm.fli'.
And we want that the images are written in PPM-ascii format.
In this case we give the command:
.PP
.nf
	% unflick -a nicefilm.fli picture
.fi
.LP
The output files have the names
.PP
.nf
	picture.001, picture.002, picture.003, ...
.fi
.LP
In the second example we assume that the utility 
.B ppmtogif
of the PBMPLUS package is available.
We extract all images and write them in GIF format
using the command line
.PP
.nf
	% unflick -fppmtogif nicefilm.fli pic gif
.fi
.LP
The names of the images are 
.PP
.nf
	pic001.gif, pic002.gif, pic003.gif, ...
.fi
.LP
If we have the FBM package instead of PBMPLUS, we can use the 
.B fbcat
utility.
This filter reads FBM and can write several formats. 
To extract images in GIF format we type
.PP
.nf
	% unflick -m -f "fbcat -G" nicefilm.fli pic gif
.fi
.LP
In the last example 
we are interested only in the 10th image of the FLI-animation. 
We wish the output image in gzipped PPM-raw format. 
To do this we type the command:
.PP
.nf
	% unflick -b 10 -n 1 -fgzip nicefilm.fli pic ppm.gz
.fi
.LP
The output file has the name `pic010.ppm.gz'.
